# AWS CodeBuild Docker Image Build and Push Pipeline

This repository demonstrates an AWS CodeBuild pipeline for building and pushing Docker images to Amazon ECR. The pipeline performs the following steps: installing dependencies, logging in to Amazon ECR, building the Docker image, and pushing it to the ECR repository. It also generates an `imagedefinitions.json` file for deployment.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials
- Docker installed on your local machine (for local testing)
- Docker image code and assets

## AWS CodeBuild Configuration

The `buildspec.yml` file in this repository contains the CodeBuild pipeline configuration. It specifies the installation, pre-build, build, and post-build phases. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Install Phase**: Sets up the runtime environment for the build. It starts the Docker daemon and ensures Docker is available for use.

2. **Pre-Build Phase**: Logs in to Amazon ECR, sets up environment variables, and prepares the Docker image repository and tag.

3. **Build Phase**: Builds the Docker image based on the Dockerfile in the repository and tags it with both `latest` and a specific image tag.

4. **Post-Build Phase**: Pushes the Docker image to Amazon ECR, generates the `imagedefinitions.json` file for deployment, and pushes this file to the pipeline artifacts.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-codebuild-docker-pipeline.git
cd aws-codebuild-docker-pipeline

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash

cd aws-codebuild-docker-pipeline
Make any necessary changes to your Docker image code and assets.

Modify the buildspec.yml file if needed, adjusting environment variables or build steps.

Commit and push your changes to trigger the AWS CodeBuild pipeline.

The pipeline will automatically build and push the Docker image to Amazon ECR, creating an imagedefinitions.json file for deployment.

Deployment
The imagedefinitions.json file generated by the pipeline can be used in your deployment process to specify the Docker image for your application.
